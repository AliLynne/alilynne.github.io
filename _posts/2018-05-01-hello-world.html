<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>Hi world.</p>
<p>While this is hardly the first blog post that I've written, it's one of the first I've written in quite a few years. I have a single blog post on Medium that I wrote during my bootcamp days that I plan on adjusting, updating and polishing before moving it here, but otherwise, it's been years since I wrote much for the world.

<p>I'm writing this one now before I get all nervous and decide not to do it yet. I always worry so much about what my blog looks like that I end up not wanting to make posts. In order to combat this, I thought I'd blog about what making a blog is like. If you're reading this on the date it was published, or close to it, it'll look something like this:</p>
